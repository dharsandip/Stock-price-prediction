# Time Series Predictions of Stock Prices with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

This is Huge Stock Market Dataset from Kaggle.
Historical daily prices and volumes of U.S. stocks are provided.
Time series predictions of Stock prices is done using RNN (Recurrent 
Neural Network). Training dataset contains stock price data
of 11956 lines (starting from 02-01-1970 to 23-05-2017. We are using
only "Open" stock price data. Test set contains stock price
data of 120 lines (starting from 24-05-2017 to 10-11-2017).

Results of RNN predictions:

RMSE of training set: 0.010692821777409418

RMSE of test set: 0.9003230607188079
